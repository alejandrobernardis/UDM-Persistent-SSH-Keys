# UDMP Persistence SSH Keys

## Persistence on Reboot

The setup script must be run every time the system is rebooted since the __/root/.ssh/authorized_keys__ overwrites every boot.  
This can be accomplished with a boot script. Flow its guide [UDM / UDMPro Boot Script]([UDM / UDMPro Boot Script](https://github.com/boostchicken-dev/udm-utilities/tree/master/on-boot-script))

## Installation



```bash
